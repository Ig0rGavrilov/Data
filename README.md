### POST-PANDEMIC ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS PATTERNS AND IMPACTS  

**Abstract**: This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on road accident trends in the Czech Republic from 2015 to 2024, utilizing a comprehensive
dataset of over one million recorded accidents. The research highlights a significant decline in accident rates during the strict lockdown periods, correlating reduced
mobility with fewer traffic incidents. As restrictions eased, accident rat es rose again, revealing seasonal variations and regional disparities, particularly in urban
areas like Prague. Findings suggest that the pandemic has reshaped commuting patterns and could influence future traffic management strategies. The analysis
underscores the need for targeted policies to enhance road safety, especially during high-risk seasons.
